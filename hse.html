            <p>Our HSE protocols are built on the "Zero-Harm" philosophy. As Uganda prepares for First Oil 2026, we ensure that your operations meet both <strong>ISO 45001</strong> and <strong>ISO 14001</strong> international standards while remaining compliant with local NEMA regulations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We don't just provide safety manuals; we build a culture of leadership where every worker is an HSE supervisor. Our systems are optimized for the **Coolstar HD Audio** enabled communication environments, ensuring clear, critical alerts in high-noise industrial zones [cite: 2026-01-23].</p>
